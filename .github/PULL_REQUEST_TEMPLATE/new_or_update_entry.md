**awesome-firebase addition checklist**

- [ ] is the source `https`?
- [ ] is the source [recent, recently updated, heavily used or heavily referenced](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)?
- [ ] have you included the appropriate [legend emoji](../../README.md#legend)?
- [ ] the item has the following format:
  ```
  - :legend emoji: [item name](https link) - Description beginning with capital, ending in period.
  ```
  the item name should be case sensitive following the source where possible, unless it is a library/framework, where you should use the package name (minus any weird conventions enforced by the tooling, say, [npm scoped packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope)).
  ```
  @jthegedus/cool-lib
  # becomes
  cool-lib
  ```

**contributions**

- [ ] name added to, or already exists on, the contributors list (not required)
  ```shell
  # add yourself with
  yarn contributors:add
  # or
  npm run contributors:add
  ```
